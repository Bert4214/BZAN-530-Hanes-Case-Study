```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read In Data

Read in the .csv file that Hanes provided us. Make sure your current working directory is set to your cloned GitHub repo

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
HANES <- read_excel("UT_blockgroup_data.xlsx")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
